  - http://jmjcando.github.com/Bookmarks/jmj.htm?version=old  - Jayesh J (old)
  - http://jmjcando.github.com/Bookmarks/jmj.htm?data=mock  - Jayesh J (mock data, useful for testing)


# Features:
- query-string:  
  - version=old shows old version (non--bootstrap)
  - data=mock uses mockdata

# NOTE:
- For issues refer to github repository https://github.com/jmjcando/bookmarks/issues
- Visual Studio Code is used, so all files in the folder tree are used. bookmarks.sln (Visual studio) is not up-to-date and not used anymore. If Visul studio is used then open folder as web-site.
- This is better handled in Visual studio code rather than Visual studio.
