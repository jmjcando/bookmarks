  - http://jmjcando.github.com/jmjBookmarks/jmj.htm?data=mock  - Jayesh J (mock data, useful for testing)


# Features:
- query-string:  
  - version=old shows old version (non--bootstrap)
  - data=mock uses mockdata

# NOTE:
- For issues refer to github repository https://github.com/jmjcando/bookmarks/issues
- This is better handle in Visual studio code rather than Visual studio.
