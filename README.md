  - http://jmjcando.github.com/Bookmarks/jmj.htm?data=mock  - Jayesh J (mock data, useful for testing)


### Features:
- query-string:  
  - **version=old** shows old version (non--bootstrap)
  - **data=mock** uses mockdata

### NOTE:
- Use http-server (installed via node) to run on local machine (development) on command-line 
    ```
      http-server
    ```
    http-server is needed because angularjs uses xhr to load templeteUrl. or any other web-server is also just fine. May be IIS or IIS express.
- **issues:** refer to github repository https://github.com/jmjcando/bookmarks/issues
- **Visual Studio Code** is advisable to use with this project, so all files in the folder tree are used. 
- **Visul studio** if used then open folder as web-site. bookmarks.sln (Visual studio) is not up-to-date and not used anymore. 
- **angularjs unit test:** all tests files need to be reviwed.
